# AuthPE
Authentication system for RedstoneLamp


# What is AuthPE
AuthPE allows RedstoneLamp to be more secure as it adds an authentication system to RedstoneLamp to block intruders from connecting to your server and pretending to be you.  When you install the plugin you will be prompted to register/login when you connect to the server.


TIP: Do NOT share your password with ANYONE if you do not want to be griefed!
